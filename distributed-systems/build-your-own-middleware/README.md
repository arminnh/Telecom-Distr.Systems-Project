### Distributed Systems Lab 1: Build your own middleware

In this first lab session you will design and implement your own RMI-platform.  
As you can expect, this will not be a full-blown RMI implementation – this would lead us too far – but it should provide you with more insight into the basics of such a platform. This lab session contains four major tasks:

    1. Creating an object to provide some straightforward functionality
    2. Designing and implementing the Server-side of the RMI platform
    3. Designing and implementing the Client-side of the RMI platform
    4. Creating an object to consume the functionality offered by the previous object and
    
To complete these tasks, you will be guided by a number questions and implementation subtasks. The programming language chosen for this lab session is Java 7 and Eclipse is used as IDE.
